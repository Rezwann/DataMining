In the example code below, we will draw a boxplot to identify the columns in the table that contain outliers. Note that the values in all columns (except for 'Bare Nuclei') are originally stored as 'int64' whereas the values in the 'Bare Nuclei' column are stored as string objects (since the column initially contains strings such as '?' for representing missing values). Thus, we must  convert the column into numeric values first before creating the boxplot. Otherwise, the column will not be displayed when drawing the boxplot.\n",

        "This is a model-free outlier detection approach as it does not require constructing an explicit model of the normal class to determine the outlier score of data instances. The example code shown below employs the k-nearest neighbor approach to calculate the outlier score. Specifically, a normal instance is expected to have a small distance to its k-th nearest neighbour whereas an outlier is likely to have a large distance to its k-th nearest neighbour. In the example below, we apply the distance-based approach with k=4 to identify the anomalous trading days from the stock market data described in the previous section.\n",
